# IMS (Inventory Management System)
#### The app is a tool designed to help users manage and customize their inventory in an efficient and personalized way. The app includes various features, such as the ability to create and delete categories and locations, as well as the ability to create, edit, and view items in the inventory. The home page allows users to select whether they are a regular employee or a manager, and the main page allows users to choose from various options such as creating new categories, locations, or items, or viewing their current inventory.

## Here are some screenshots of the app in action:
